## Configuration file for CAVA. Default values are commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting.

[general]
mode = normal # defines smoothing mode, can be normal, scientific or waves.
framerate = 60 # Default: 60. Accepts only non-negative values.
sensitivity = 100 #  is sensitivity %. Accepts only non-negative values.
bars = 50 # defines the amount of bars. 0 sets it to auto (25 + fill up leftover space). 

[input]
method = alsa # supported input methods are 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
source = pulse # ALSA device or FIFO path.

[output]
; method = ncurses # may be ncurses, noncurses or circle.

[color]
# supported colors are: red, green, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, blue, black.
background = black
foreground = cyan

[smoothing]
; integral = 0.7 # multiplier for the integral smoothing calculations. Takes values from 0 - 0.99. Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
; monstercat = 1 # disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing". Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable. 
gravity = 2 # Set gravity multiplier for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster. Accepts only non-negative values. 0.5 means half gravity, 2 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
; ignore = 0 # set bars with height lower than this to 0

[eq]
# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want. More keys = more precision. Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
; 1 = 1 # bass
; 2 = 1
; 3 = 1
; 4 = 1
; 5 = 1 # treble
